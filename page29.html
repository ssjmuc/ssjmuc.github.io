</p><p>In the fall of 1898 the corner stone of the present handsome church was laid, and it was completed and dedicated in July, 1899. The present pastor is the Rev. Louis Gabriel.</p></div>

                <div class="lead"><p>The first Catholic Church in North Hudson was located within the present limits of the Town of West Hoboken, and before its establishment here the people of that faith either had to journey to lower Jersey City or to New York City, and many people worshipped in the old Catholic Church in Barclay street, in the latter city.
<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"></span></p><p>In the latter part of the year 1840, Father Cauvin, a priest who then lived in Hoboken, used to journey up the Hillside on Sunday mornings to celebrate mass for the scattered Catholics of West Hoboken, and the surrounding villages, coming even as far as from Guttenberg and Hudson County.
</p><p>The building used as a church at that time (and which was in reality the first Catholic Church hereabouts) was the coach-house of Mr. James Kerrigan, on the old Homestead.
</p><p>The people worshipped in the coach-house until the year 1851. Early in that year work was commenced on a frame church named "Our Lady of Mercy," more familiarly known as (St. Mary's), on the corner of Clinton avenue, and what was then known as Kerrigan's Lane, now High street. The land, half an acre in extent, was the gift of Mr. Kerrigan.<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"></span></p><p>The parish was then in New York, the diocese of Newark not having been formed until October, 1853, and in the latter part of the year 1851, Archbishop Hughes, of New York, dedicated the church.</p><p>This church was presided over for ten years by Faithful Father Cauvin, and on Sunday, September 29, 1860, Fathers Gaudentius and Anthony, of the Passionist Order, opened a mission in St. Mary's Church. It was most successful, and soon after, the Rt. Rev. Bishop James Roosevelt Bailey, first bishop of the Diocese of Newark, invited the Passionists to establish themselves in his diocese.
<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"></span></p><p>The Fathers accepted his invitation and selected West Hoboken, then but a sparsely settled hamlet as their headquarters, and on April 27, 1861, they formally took charge of St. Mary's Church, with Very Rev. Father John Domenic Taolatini as pastor. Father Cauvin turned the keys of the church over to the new pastor and bade the people of St. Mary's farewell. He then retired to Hoboken to build a church in the latter city.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the same year twenty acres of land known as "Kerrigan's woods," was purchased as a site on which to build a Monastery. The site, at that time, was not considered a very healthy one on account of the swampiness of the land. But the history of the Monks repeated itself, for to-day no finer spot could be found in North Hudson than the land surrounding the Monastery.
</p><p>The new Mission of the Passionists being established, Very Rev. Father Victor Carunchio was appointed Superior.
</p><p>The small house at the rear of St. Mary's being found wholly inadequate, was moved back, and a very comfortable frame building was erected in its place.<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"></span></p><p>Such was the neucleus from which sprang St. Michael's Monastery parish.
<span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"></span></p><p>Work was soon commenced on the new Monastery; a building of blue stone, 101 feet long by 36 feet in width. The corner stone was laid on August 9, 1863, and three sermons were preached on this occasion, one by Dr. McGlynn, in English; Father Cauvin, in French, and Father Stanislaus, in German.
</p><p>In the latter year St. Mary's school was erected on a plot of ground opposite St. Mary's church, also the gift of Mr. Kerrigan.
</p><p>On September 25, 1864, the Monastery was solemnly dedicated, and on the same day the little band of Passionists bade farewell to St. Mary's, just three years and five months after their advent in West Hoboken.
</p><p>In October a wing 65 feet long by 50 feet wide was added to the Monastery, and on December 30 of the same year, the beautiful chapel erected in the new wing spoken of, was dedicated by Rt. Rev. Bernard J. McQuaid, then elect and Bishop of Rochester, New York.
</p><p>On June 29, 1867, Blessed Paul of the Cross, the Founder of the Passionist Order, was Canonized by Pope Pius the 9th. For this occasion a frame building, 150 feet long and 60 feet wide, was erected where now stands the magnificent stone structure, St. Michael's Monastery Church.
</p><p>
</p><p>The number who attended the services was legion. There were present bishops and clergy from all parts of the States. This temporary building was torn down, and in November, 1867,
</p><p>the first huge stone was rolled in place for the new church, and actual building on the church was commenced in April, 1869. The corner stone was laid on Sunday, July 18, 1869, in the presence of the largest multitude that ever assembled in Hudson County for a similar purpose, and on July 22, 1870, St. Mary's Church, amid the lamentations of its old parishioners, was closed forever to divine services.
</p><p>On July 4, 1875, the superb church of St. Michael the Archangel was dedicated amid all the pomp and splendor possible. At this time Very Rev. John Phillip Baudinelli was rector.
